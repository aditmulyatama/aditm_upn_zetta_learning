            Denji has a simple dream—to live a happy and peaceful life, spending
            time with a girl he likes. This is a far cry from reality, however,
            as Denji is forced by the yakuza into killing devils in order to pay
            off his crushing debts. Using his pet devil Pochita as a weapon, he
            is ready to do anything for a bit of cash.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, he has outlived his usefulness and is murdered by a
            devil in contract with the yakuza. However, in an unexpected turn of
            events, Pochita merges with Denji's dead body and grants him the
            powers of a chainsaw devil. Now able to transform parts of his body
            into chainsaws, a revived Denji uses his new abilities to quickly
            and brutally dispatch his enemies. Catching the eye of the official
            devil hunters who arrive at the scene, he is offered work at the
            Public Safety Bureau as one of them. Now with the means to face even
            the toughest of enemies, Denji will stop at nothing to achieve his
            simple teenage dreams.

            Corrupt politicians, frenzied nationalists, and other warmongering
            forces constantly jeopardize the thin veneer of peace between
            neighboring countries Ostania and Westalis. In spite of their plots,
            renowned spy and master of disguise "Twilight" fulfills dangerous
            missions one after another in the hope that no child will have to
            experience the horrors of war.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the bustling Ostanian city of Berlint, Twilight dons the alias of
            "Loid Forger," an esteemed psychiatrist. However, his true intention
            is to gather intelligence on prominent politician Donovan Desmond,
            who only appears rarely in public at his sons' school: the
            prestigious Eden Academy. Enlisting the help of unmarried city hall
            clerk Yor Briar to act as his wife and adopting the curious
            six-year-old orphan Anya as his daughter, Loid enacts his master
            plan. He will enroll Anya in Eden Academy, where Loid hopes she will
            excel and give him the opportunity to meet Donovan without arousing
            suspicion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately for Loid, even a man of his talents has trouble
            playing the figure of a loving father and husband. And just like
            Loid is hiding his true identity, Yor—who is an underground assassin
            known as "Thorn Princess"—and Anya—an esper who can read people's
            minds—have no plans to disclose their own secrets either. Although
            this picture-perfect family is founded on deception, the Forgers
            gradually come to understand that the love they share for one
            another trumps all else.

            The appearance of "quirks," newly discovered super powers, has been
            steadily increasing over the years, with 80 percent of humanity
            possessing various abilities from manipulation of elements to
            shapeshifting. This leaves the remainder of the world completely
            powerless, and Izuku Midoriya is one such individual.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since he was a child, the ambitious middle schooler has wanted
            nothing more than to be a hero. Izuku's unfair fate leaves him
            admiring heroes and taking notes on them whenever he can. But it
            seems that his persistence has borne some fruit: Izuku meets the
            number one hero and his personal idol, All Might. All Might's quirk
            is a unique ability that can be inherited, and he has chosen Izuku
            to be his successor!
          </p>
          <p>
            Enduring many months of grueling training, Izuku enrolls in UA High,
            a prestigious high school famous for its excellent hero training
            program, and this year's freshmen look especially promising. With
            his bizarre but talented classmates and the looming threat of a
            villainous organization, Izuku will soon learn what it really means
            to be a hero.

            <h2>Poputepipikku 2nd Season</h2>
          </div>

          <p>
            Poputepipikku turns absurdist comedy up to eleven with its pop
            culture references and surreal hilarity. With two bonafide high
            school girl protagonists—the short and exceptionally quick to anger
            Popuko, and the tall and unshakably calm Pipimi—they throw genres
            against the wall and don't wait to see what sticks. Parody is
            interlaced with drama, action, crudeness, and the show's overarching
            goal—to become a real anime.
